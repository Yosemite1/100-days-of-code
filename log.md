# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I learned about scopes, both global and functional, as well as arryas and loops

**Thoughts:** I understood most but don't understand how the loops work. The tutorial said to set the varaible to 0 and then the stop condition was to see if the variable was less than the length of the array. Why does the loop work if  it is alredy less than 0

**Link to work:** Not avaible right now
