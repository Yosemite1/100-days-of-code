# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I learned about scopes, both global and functional, as well as arryas and loops

**Thoughts:** I understood most but don't understand how the loops work. The tutorial said to set the varaible to 0 and then the stop condition was to see if the variable was less than the length of the array. Why does the loop work if  it is alredy less than 0

**Link to work:** Not avaible right now

### Day 2: january 4, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Did more codecademy lessons. Learned about while loops and JQuery

**Thoughts**: JQuery seems really helpful for doing things faster. I liked learning about how to make parts of a webpage fade in.

**Link(s) to work**: Not sure what to do to get a link


### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
